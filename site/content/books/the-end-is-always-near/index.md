Carlin's *Hardcore History* podcast, especially his series on World War 1, got me hooked on history. This book is essentially a series of his podcast episodes, strung together as book chapters, and it works quite well. He explores the bronze age collapse, the history of parenting, pandemics (this was published just before the 2020 COVID pandemics), and war.
