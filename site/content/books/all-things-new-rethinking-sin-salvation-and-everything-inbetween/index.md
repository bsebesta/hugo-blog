Do the words we use matter? Terryl & Fiona Givens think they do, and in this book, they argue that as Latter-day Saints, we've inherited a religious vocabulary that doesn't do justice to what the Restoration teaches about grace, worth, sin, and salvation. In typical, erudite style, they draw from sources all over to make their case that as disciples of the Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ, we need to find new ways to make these words come alive.
